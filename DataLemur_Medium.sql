# Problem Medium Level : Sportify Top 5 Artit

# Assume there are three Spotify tables containing information about the artists, songs, and music charts. 
Write a query to determine the top 5 artists whose songs appear in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table the highest number of times.
From now on, we'll refer to this ranking number as "song appearances".

Output the top 5 artist names in ascending order along with their song appearances ranking (not the number of song appearances,
but the rank of who has the most appearances). The order of the rank should take precedence.

For example, Ed Sheeran's songs appeared 5 times in Top 10 list of the global song rank table; this is the highest number of appearances, 
so he is ranked 1st. Bad Bunny's songs appeared in the list 4, so he comes in at a close 2nd.

Assumptions:

If two artists' songs have the same number of appearances, the artists should have the same rank.
The rank number should be continuous (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5) and not skipped (1, 2, 2, 4, 5).

# Problem : App Click-through Rate (CTR)  [Facebook]

#This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. 
Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

- To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.
- Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
